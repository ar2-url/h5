Question

Does a “chained” selector have a higher specificity than a class or id selector? For example, which selector would “win”: .special or h1.special or #special?
Answer

A chained or qualified selector has a higher specificity than a class selector but a lower specificity than the id selector. Hence, assuming these selectors are all targeting the same HTML tag, the specificity from highest to lowest would be:
1) #special
2) h1.special
3) .special
